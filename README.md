# Employee_Salary_Prediction_By_Machine_Learning

## Project Overview
This capstone project develops a data-driven solution to address salary disparities in organizations. By leveraging machine learning, it predicts equitable compensation based on objective factors like experience, education, and role, helping HR departments make fair and consistent salary decisions.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Examines distributions of age, gender, education levels, and experience
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic plots including histograms, bar charts, and scatter matrices
- **Multi-Model Framework**: Implements Random Forest Regression with 92% accuracy (RÂ² score)
- **Bias Detection**: Analyzes salary patterns across demographics to identify potential biases
- **Deployment Ready**: Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy reproducibility
